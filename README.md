This is a banking application I built using Spring Boot 3.x and Java 17 to showcase my skills in developing secure, scalable, and user-friendly applications. The project focuses on core banking functionalities like account management, transactions, and email notifications, while integrating modern tools and technologies.

Some highlights of the project:

Implemented JWT security for authentication and authorization to ensure data safety.

Used H2 in-memory database for faster development and testing.
Added real-time email alerts for key banking activities using Spring Boot Mail.

Documented all APIs using Swagger UI, making it easy to test and integrate.

Simplified code with Lombok to focus more on business logic. Included robust unit and integration testing with Spring Boot Starter Test to ensure reliability.

This project helped me explore and implement the complete development cycle for a real-world application, from backend logic to API documentation.

Iâ€™ll also include media files like architecture diagrams, API screenshots, and sample outputs to give you a better idea of the work. Check out the GitHub link for more details!
